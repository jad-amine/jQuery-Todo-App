Todo data: Id, Title, Description, Point, IsDone, CreatedAt
- by default Todos will be listed descending by creation date/time
- user can change the arrangement based on the Point of the Todo
- can search based on the Title & Description
- can add update & delete Todo
- each todo can be updated as done and should be listed grayed out in a different list
- todos should be cached in the browser, so if we close the app and then reopen it, my data shouldn't be lost
Note:
- Point attribute is a range from 1 to 5, which means Todo with 5 is more important to be done than 4, 3, etc..
- Id should be randomly generated
- Title & Description are text with textarea
- CreatedAt is the time that Todo is created (timestamp)
- IsDone by default false then can be changed to true (boolean)
Bonus: DueDate (attribute)
- DueDate is the date that the Todo should be done (timestamp)
- if 1hr remained for the DueDate, the Todo element should change its style (background color, border, or font)
